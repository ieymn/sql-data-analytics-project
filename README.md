📊 SQL Data Analytics Project

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts that I built to explore, analyze, and understand data inside a relational database. The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical SQL techniques that support real-world analytics — from simple data checks to more advanced business insights.

Each script focuses on a specific analysis area, making it easy to reuse, modify, or plug into other projects.
